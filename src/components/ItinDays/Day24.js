          Today we will be touring through some of the famous cultural and

            We will be meeting at the Sagrada Familia at 10AM today to start
            things off. This famous cathedral has been under construction for
            almost 100 years and is one of the most recognizable sites in the
            city.

            We don't intend to go insider(the wait can be quite long) but feel
            free to do so independently
